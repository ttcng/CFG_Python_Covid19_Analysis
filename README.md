# CFG-project
As part of Code First Girls Python course - Spreadsheet analysis. This is the final project showcasing use of Pandas to prepare and analyse large data sets. We used COVID-19 data (from Kaggle) as part of a data manipulation project, and looked at the trends of Covid-19 infections over time.
